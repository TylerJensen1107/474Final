            In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending.

            A diatonic scale is one that has no added sharps or flats other than what is in the key signature -- the scale's interval pattern could be played using only the white keys on the piano.

            <p>
            A chord is any set of three or more notes being played at the same time<br>
            One of the most common chords is a triad. This chord is composed of a root note, a third, and a fifth. Given any root note, the third is the third note from that note. The fifth is the fifth from that root note.<br>
            Basically, you skip one note inbetween
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="cMajTriad.png"><br>
              In a C major triad, the C is the root, the E is the third and the G is the fifth
            </p>
            <p>
              Chords are notated by which note the root is in the scale. So a C major triad in the key of C major is a 1 (I) chord, because C is the first note in the scale<br>
              D is a second (ii), E is a third (iii), so on so forth.
