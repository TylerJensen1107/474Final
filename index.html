            A scale is any set of notes in order of frequency, spanning an octave. In Western music, the two most common scales are the major and minor scales, comprised of 8 notes each. Major scales sound happy, and minor scales sound sad. 

            On the piano, a C major scale is played on only the white notes, in ascending order.

            A diatonic scale is one that has no added sharps or flats other than what is in the key signature -- the scale's interval pattern could be played using only the white keys on the piano. 
            The diatonic scale is.

            <p>
            A chord is any set of three or more notes being played at the same time<br>
            One of the most common chords is a triad. This chord is comprised of three notes- a root note, a third, and a fifth. Given any root note, the third is the third note above that note. The fifth is the fifth from that root note.<br>
            Basically, you skip one note to get to the next note (root - skip the 2nd note - third - skip the 4th - fifth).
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="cMajTriad.png"><br>
              In a C major triad, the C is the root, the E is the third and the G is the fifth.

              In a G major tried, the G is the root, the B is the third and the D is the fifth. Remember that. The C major scale (CDEFGAB) loops back to C at the end of the octave (CDEFGABCDEFGABC, and so on).

            Note: An octave is C to C (or D to D, etc.), where the two pitches sound the same note but one is higher in pitch.

            <p>
              Chords are assigned roman numerals based on their root note in the scale. For a C major chord in the scale of C major, since C is the root and the first note in the scale, it is assigned roman numeral (I). A G major chord begins on the note G, which is the fifth note in the C major scale. So it is called the (V) chord. Furthermore, a chord beginning on F would be called a (IV) chord. 

              Note: Major chords are denoated with an upper case roman numeral, and minor chords are marked by lower case numerals. For example, a chord beginning on the second note in the scale, D, will be minor (sad sounding) and is written (ii). <br>

          <div class="title">Chord Relationships</div>
            All songs and pieces of music contain chord progressions, which are series of chords that are strung together. In classical music, composers use the (I) chord as a "home" chord and always come back to it. The (V) chord sounds tense, and the listener's ear wants to hear a return to (I). In the finale of a symphony, you can count on composers writing many (V) to (I) chord progressions. This relationship is also found in most other genres.
